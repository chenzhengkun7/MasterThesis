\chapter{Vibration Condition Monitoring for RUL Estimation}

\chapterintrobox{Vibration condition monitoring are vibtal for many industrial systems, vibration data contains very useful information about health state of the equipment. Nevertheless, gaining insights from vibration signals in real-world applications turns out to be a complex—and in many times, unfruitful—process. This is mainly due to the complexity of the problem. This chapter introduces an approach for remaining useful life estimation from bearings vibration data using discrete wavelet transform, these features serve as an input to a convolutional neural network architecture that is used for predicting the remaining useful life.}
